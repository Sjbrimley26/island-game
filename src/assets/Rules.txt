Player can move once and use 1 item per turn .
Player gains a common item every turn unless their inventory has more than 6 items,
and an uncommon if it is past turn 5.
Most items have charges, so they can only be used a few times.
Some items are "free" and can be used even if the player has used another item,
but only once a turn per item (should probably be 1 extra free item a turn?).
Players have sanity, which if it hits 0, causes them to "go insane" and be stunned for
the turn.
Players also have luck, which increases when bad things happen and vice versa.
The luck influences the players odds of good outcomes when using items (and maybe elsewhere?).
If the player has high luck at the beginning of their turn, their luck will go down a bit.
At the end of each turn, Players lose random items until they have 6 (should probably let them pick).

The island will be 7 tiles to the center from any edge,
so the game will be about 14 - 20 turns.
The goal is to grab an artifact from the center and get out.
